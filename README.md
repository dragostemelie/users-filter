This project is a challenge from Alex Zmed.

- [x] When a user is deleted by pressing (-), it fades out.
- [x] Page is responsive:
  - 4 users / row on tablet and desktop;
  - 6 users / row on 2k and above;
  - On mobile, search is presented as a fixed header, and users are shown on one row full width
- [x] User list has a transition hover effect
- [x] Click counter is shown before the delete button if count is > 0.
- [x] Click event is recorded only when the user clicks the “User x” text inside the card.
